1. Compression is enabled on producer side by setting "compression.type"
2. The values are snappy, gzip, lz4 etc.
3. snappy and lz4 has good speed to compression ratio
4. gzip has very good compression but it is slow as well
5. Compression happens at batch level
6. Bigger the batch higher the compression
7. To increase throughput we can increase the "batch.size", increase "linger.ms"


When the producer sends a message, the message is sent immediately as "linger.ms=0" by default.
Now the producer waits for ack. In the waiting time if the producer receives more messages to send,
it will batch them and send the batch as a whole. Why increase the linger.ms to say 5.
Producer waits for 5 ms after a message is ready to be sent. During this time if there are more messages being
produced to send, these messages will be batched. Thus increasing the chances of messages being sent as a batch.

As compression applies on the batch as a whole and as batch size increases the compression ratio also increases,
We get increased throughput.

If the size of messages in KB in the batch reaches the batch.size(default value is 16KB) value then the producer will not wait for the linger.ms
timer to expire, it will send the batch right away.
