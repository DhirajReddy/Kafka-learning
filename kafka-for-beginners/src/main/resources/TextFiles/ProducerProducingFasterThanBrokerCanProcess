If the producer starts sending messages faster than the broker can process there will be exceptions thrown.
We can handle fast produces using the following settings.

1. buffer.memory : The default value is 32MB. This is the buffer size of the .send() method.
If the producer starts calling the send method fast enough it will fill up this buffer.
Once the buffer is full the send will no longer be an async call. .send() calls after the buffer size is full are sync.

3. After .send() is called synchronously producer wait for "max.block.ms" time before throwing an exception.
The default value of "max.block.ms" is 60000 i.e. 60s
