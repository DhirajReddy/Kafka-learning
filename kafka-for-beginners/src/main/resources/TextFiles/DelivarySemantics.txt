1. At Most once:
kafka consumer reads data in batches.
A consumer reads a batch and commits the last messageâ€™s offset of the batch before the messages are processed.
If during processing the consumer goes down and it comes back up, the unprocessed messages are lost as the offset
is already committed, the consumer will start reading messages from the new offset.

2. At Least once:
When the consumer starts processing the next batch. It processes messages one and two but does not commit the offset of
second batch as there are still 3 more messages to be processed. After the second message if the consumer goes down
and comes back up again, it will start processing the messages from one again. This leads to the messages one and two
being processed again. If the processing of the messages are not idempotent this leads to duplication of messages.

3. Exactly once:
This is only for kafka to kafka work flows.
