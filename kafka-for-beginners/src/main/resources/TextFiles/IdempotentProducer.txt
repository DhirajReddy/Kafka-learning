By setting "enable.idempotence=true" on producer side we can guarantee ordering and no duplicates without sacrificing
parallel behavior i.e. we can still have "max.in.flight.requests.per.connection" set to greater than 0 but less than
or equal to 5. This means up to 5 requests can be sent at a time and producer waits for the ack from each of these
5 requests.

Each kafka producer instance will have an ID called PID. And each message produced by this producer will have an Id
called Sequence ID. When a partition receives a message it will see the sequence and producer ID, and it will commit
the message only of the Sequence ID is one greater than the already committed message. If it is not an exception is thrown.
Producer will retry again with the same sequence Id and producer Id until the message gets committed.

This way we can have a buffer of more than 0 and less than or equal to 5 and still achieve order and no duplicates.
